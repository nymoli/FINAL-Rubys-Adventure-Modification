# FINAL-Rubys-Adventure-Modification

Original Challenge:
For the original challenge, the error I made was that I forgot to change the win text in stage 2. I fixed the win text by creating if statements based on the stage Ruby is currently in and made sure that when she fixed all the robots, the text goes from “Talk to Jambi” to “You win!” 

Visual Changes:
I made three visual changes and they all involve creating new characters. I added a new robot sprite to represent the Tough Robot. It is a unique sprite that is distinguished from the other robots. I also added extra animations to the robot. I also added are a cat and an anime-inspired girl. They both have idle animations and they do not contribute to the game.

Audio Changes:
The two audio changes I made are for the collectible ammo and Jambi. I used a gear sound to the collectible ammo. It only plays when Ruby collects it to gain more cog ammo. I also used a frog sound for when Ruby talks to Jambi. It only plays when the player presses X when Ruby is near Jambi.

Gameplay Changes:
I made two important gameplay changes to improve the game. I made a Tough Robot that both follows Ruby and gets fixed with three hits. They are both significant changes since they create new challenges for the player. The two robots have linear movement. The new robot is just as flexible as the player. The other two robots require one hit to be fixed. The new robot must be hit a few times to get fixed. These challenge the player to think about where to go to stop the tough robot’s movement while aiming carefully to hit it three times to fix it.
